# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Create the first react app using Create React App tool. Familiarizing with Folder structure and files.
- Created multiple child components
- Used `props` and `useState` hook

**Thoughts:** Always wanted to explore React and the time has finally come. I was not a fan of writing HTML is JS, but yeah, this is me doing the same thing now.

### Day 2: May 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Learned conditional rendering
- Learned list iterations
- Debugging React applications
- Styled Components and Radium

**Thoughts:** Angular have directives like `ngIf` and `ngFor` for conditional rendering and list iterations. In React its all JavaScript. Really getting the essence of React.

### Day 3: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Breaking down application into components
- Learned about component lifecycle
- `useEffect()` hook

**Thoughts:** There are fewer lifecycle hooks in react compared to Angular. Its a bit confusing at first, but definitely gonna put some effort into learning more about lifecycles and how it can be used in real world applications.

### Day 4: May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Spend more time learning hooks
- Tried making API call in `useEffect()` hook.

### Day 5: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Spend more time on trying component lifecycle.
- Learned about `PureComponents`.
- Higher order componets.
- More on setState using object and functions.
- Using `prop-types` for type checking.
- References

### Day 6: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Started with React Native side by side.
- Bootstrapped my first ever react native app.
- Started using TSX(for native app)
- Learned about Context APIs in react.

### Day 7: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Started with TSX in react native.
- Created multiple components like the Header, Movie Card, etc...
- Familiarized with debugging React Native Code.

### Day 8: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Refresher on State management
- Refresher on passing events across components

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly going throught the core concepts once again to make sure I learn it thorough. Sometimes you have to slow down a little bit and look back.

### Day 9: May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Routing in React using React Router package
- More on calling APIs using Axios
- More state management
- Creating modular components

**Thoughts:** Routing in Angular is separated into a separate module and I feel it is really good that way. In React, I don't know if there are ways to separate your whole routing strategy. But working with `react-router` package is so easy and convenient.
