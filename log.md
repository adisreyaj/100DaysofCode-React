# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Create the first react app using Create React App tool. Familiarizing with Folder structure and files.
- Created multiple child components
- Used `props` and `useState` hook

**Thoughts:** Always wanted to explore React and the time has finally come. I was not a fan of writing HTML is JS, but yeah, this is me doing the same thing now.

### Day 2: May 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

- Learned conditional rendering
- Learned list iterations
- Debugging React applications
- Styled Components and Radium

**Thoughts:** Angular have directives like `ngIf` and `ngFor` for conditional rendering and list iterations. In React its all JavaScript. Really getting the essence of React.
